Experimental chezmoi migration branch. Still a work-in-progress.

## E-mail
I'm using `neomutt` with `mbsync` for offline IMAP. I can't add all the configuration files because some of them contain information I'd rather not share. Check out the [Arch Wiki page for mbsync/isync](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Isync)
